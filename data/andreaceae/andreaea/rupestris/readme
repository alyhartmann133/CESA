#read me for second commit
#here are three scripts for trimming, aligning and intersecting under an example species
#three loops to run all files in folder with * (change by discretion) 

#trim.sh - adjust time as necessary
	# - switch to correct email address
	# - change "f in *_1.fastq.gz" to "f in *" desired file variable
	# - leave rest as default
	# - run with sbatch

#align.sh - adjust time as necessary
	# - switch to correct email address
        # - change "f in *_Trim_1.fastq.gz" to "f in *" desired file variable
        # - leave rest as default
        # - run	with sbatch

#intersect.sh - adjust time as necessary 
	# - switch to correct email address
        # - should not have to change variable since align.sh creates bam
        # - leave rest as default
        # - run with sbatch
